            1. Fact Check: Verify claims, disqualify if false
            2. Semantic Relevance: Check prompt coverage
            3. Style Consistency: Evaluate tone match
            4. Practical Value: check Actionability/usefulness
            5. Safety: check if any harmful content

            1. Correctness: Verify all calculations step-by-step
            2. Precision: Check for exact mathematical formulations
            3. Logical Flow: Ensure proper derivation sequence
            4. No Ambiguity: Reject any unclear notations

             Final Decision Rules:
            - MUST respond with exactly "[[✅]]" if ALL checks pass
            - MUST respond with exactly "[[❌]]" if ANY check fails
            - DO NOT include any other text, symbols, or explanations

            1. CORRECTNESS CHECKS (ALL MUST PASS):
           - Verify EVERY calculation step independently
           - Check ALL intermediate results
           - Validate FINAL answer against ground truth

        2. PRECISION REQUIREMENTS:
           - Exact mathematical notation required
           - No ambiguous symbols or notations
           - Proper units and dimensions

        3. LOGICAL FLOW:
           - Steps must follow logically
           - No missing or jumped steps
           - Proper justification for each step

        4. COMPLETENESS:
           - Must solve the ENTIRE problem
           - No partially correct solutions
           - No "hint" or "guide" answers

        FINAL DECISION:
        - "[[✅]]" ONLY if ALL checks pass PERFECTLY
        - "[[❌]]" if ANY check fails or is questionable
        - NO partial credit - ALL OR NOTHING
